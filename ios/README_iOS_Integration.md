## Flutter Integration

### Method Channel: `medical_transcription/audio`
**Enhanced methods:**
- `startRecording(sessionId, sampleRate, secondsPerChunk)`
- `stopRecording()`
- `pauseRecording()` / `resumeRecording()`
- `setGain(gain)` / `getGain()`
- `listPendingSessions()` - Returns detailed session statistics

- `retryFailedChunks(sessionId?)` - Retry failed chunks for specific or all sessions
- `getNetworkInfo()` - Current network status and capabilities
- `getQueueStats()` - Detailed queue statistics

### Event Channel: `medical_transcription/audio_stream`
**Enhanced events:**
- `recording_started` - Recording session initiated
- `recording_stopped` - Recording session ended
- `recording_paused/resumed` - Pause/resume with reason
- `chunk_ready` - New chunk available with metadata
- `chunk_upload_ready` - Chunk ready for upload with integrity data
- `audio_level` - Real-time audio levels (RMS dB, peak)
- `audio_route_changed` - Audio device connection/disconnection
- `recording_interrupted/resumed` - Audio session interruptions
- `background_recording_active` - Background recording status
- `network_status_changed` - Network availability changes

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Scenarios
1. **Audio Session Interruptions** - Automatic resume when interruption ends
2. **Phone Calls** - Pause during calls, resume after call ends

4. **Network Outages** - Local buffering and automatic retry when network returns
5. **App Backgrounding** - Seamless background recording continuation
6. **Device Lock** - Uninterrupted recording during lock screen

### Data Integrity Measures
1. **SHA256 Checksums** - Every chunk verified before and after storage
2. **File Size Validation** - Ensures complete file writes
